# Bitlayer

Think of it as a simple implementaiton of photoshop. You can draw on a layer and then move that layer up and down the stack. For simplicity sake we will have the following limitations:

A simple drawing tool that allows you to create layers of solid colors on top of other layers.

It must all be open sourced  

You can add dots/blocks to a layer and then switch to the next layer to add dots.
You can change the color of an entire layer, but not of individual pixels.
You can rotate the viewpoint.

To save you must log in with google.
